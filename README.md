# Wai Tutorial

## Purpose
This tutorial will walk through building a test driven Haskell app from the 
ground up. We will be using wai and warp directly rather than using a framework
in order to keep things simple. The main idea behind this project is to bridge
the gap for haskell lerners who may be working through a book and give them a 
real project to build.

## Process
Each section will have a concrete goal and by the end you will have built one
piece of functionality in the app. In the beginning there may be some tests 
already written for you, or pieces of implementations and your task will be to
"fill in the blanks". Later on, the tests and implementations will be left 
empty or it will be on you to decide what tests are even needed. By the end, 
the only help you will be given will be provided in the requirements for that 
section.
  
Each section will have it's own branch. Each branch will include a solution to 
the previous sections as well as any stubbed out functions or tests provided 
for the next exercises. Each section will also include updates to 
[requirements.md](requirements.md) and [notes.md](notes.md). `requirements.md` will explain the exercise 
for the current section, while `notes.md` will include any background material, 
explanation, or links to documentation that will be required to be able to 
complete the section's exercises.

## Getting started
Make sure you have a working haskell installation (we will be using stack in 
this project), and check out [requirements.md](requirements.md)
